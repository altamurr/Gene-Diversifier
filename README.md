# Gene-Diversifier: A suite of Python scripts accompanying the article "Rational design and construction of multi-copy biomanufacturing islands in mammalian cells" (NAR, 2022).
# Gene-Diversifier uses a novel algorithm to generate divergent DNA sequences, all encoding the same protein of interest, that are optimised for expression in a user-specified mammalian host.
# Gene diversifier can be freely downloaded. Refer to accompanying instructions.txt file for instructions on how to use the program.
